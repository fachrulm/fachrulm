## Fachrul's personal repository
### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am a data scientist with 6+ years of experience in bioinformatics ðŸ§¬ðŸ’», currently working as a Postdoctoral Researcher @ [St Vincent's Institute](https://www.svi.edu.au/laboratories/human-genomics-and-evolution/).

My work focuses on analyzing large (and often messy!) multimodal omic datasets, building robust analytical pipelines, and collaborating with cross-functional, international teams to drive impactful research. I specialize in host-microbe interactions and studies involving underrepresented populations.

I am passionate about using data science to advance our understanding of human health and to promote diversity and equity in genomics research. I am also eager to continue growing my data science skillset and applying it beyond academia!
